- Fist toggles volume control: once toggled you can turn down the volume of your computer by pinching your pointer finger and thumb together 

- Palm also toggles volume control: once toggled you can turn up the volume of your computer by pinching your pointer finger and thumb together

- Ok toggles mouse control: Once toggled you can click the mouse by pinching your pointer finger and thumb together. You can also double click, by pinching both the pointer and middle finger to your thumb, right-click by pinching your ring finger and thumb together, and click and drag by pinching your middle finger and thumb together

- One toggles page control: Once toggled you can go forward a page on either your web browser or in file explorer

- Thumb toggles page control: Once toggled you can go back a page on either your web browser or in file explorer

You can go back to the function selection by pinching your thumb and pinky together. You can also close the program at any time by pinching you ring and middle fingers to your thumb
